# Caterpillar Excavator bucket tooth detection

This project is an attempt to train a custom model to detect and locate teeth in the excavator bucket. Tensorflow machine learning library from Google was used to train the custom model along with OpenCV. The model was trained with just 100 images for this project, and so the accuracy of detection can be increased by increasing the number of training images and fine tuning the configuration file between accuracy and speed.
